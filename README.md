* **System**

  [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) + [aconfmgr](https://github.com/CyberShadow/aconfmgr).

  [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is amazing. I just never got to the point of being
  able to do the same things I do on Arch. Using aconfmgr as a crutch. Hoping to
  get back into nix at some point. Perhaps start using it as a package manager
  on Arch at first...
